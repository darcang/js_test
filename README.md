My Spreadsheet App
The year is 2005, and Google Docs (and if you are old enough Google
Labs) does not exist. However, we are in desperate need of a
spreadsheet tool for internal company use. The purpose of this
challenge is to build a simple web-based spreadsheet application using
JavaScript.

Features:
• The application shall have a form with a single text input and two
buttons, "Load" and "Save"
• The application shall allow a User to enter a name in the text input
field and be able to load or save a spreadsheet based on the
entered name.
• The application shall represent spreadsheets as 2D Arrays stored as
JSON string.
• The application shall allow the User to modify and save values of a
spreadsheet.
